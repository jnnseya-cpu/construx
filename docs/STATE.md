# Project state

**This file is the single source of truth for what exists.** Read it before
starting work. Update it in the same commit as the change it describes. Do not
re-derive project state by inspecting the code — if this file is wrong, fix it
here rather than working around it.

It exists because state was previously re-derived every session, which produced
contradictory answers about what was built, repeated work that was already done,
and claims of completion that did not hold.

## What is built and verified

These are implemented, covered by tests, and exercised through the running
application. Do not rebuild them.

**Golden Thread.** Append-only hash-chained ledger. Canonical serialisation,
SHA-256, constrained RFC 6902 patches ordered remove→add→replace, closed event
catalogue, evidence requirements, AI-authorship rules. Deterministic replay with
per-event verification and a project state root hash. Tamper is detected.

**Seven engines with real arithmetic.** CPM forward/backward pass with float and
PERT probability. Earned value with three EAC scenarios. CVR with margin
erosion. S-curve cashflow. Deterministic bid scoring with penalty flags. Risk
expected value and P80 contingency. Delay attribution with concurrency. Statutory
payment cycle dates. Reliability-adjusted maintenance forecasting.

**Payment cycle, end to end.** Application → certification → payment notice →
settlement. The applicant cannot certify; the payer posts the payment. Refuses
over-certification, double certification and overpayment. Withheld sums carry a
reason.

**The Construction Act.** The statute that decides who gets paid what, and it
does not turn on who was right about the work. If the payer gives no payment
notice and no pay less notice, the sum applied for becomes the notified sum and
is payable in full however optimistic the application was. `constructionAct.ts`
computes that position rather than describing it: which notice established the
notified sum, what a missed or invalid one has already cost in money, whether
the right to suspend is open, and what has to be served next.

Building it found the hole. `PAY_LESS_NOTICE_ISSUED` was in the catalogue and
`noticePosition` read the records, but **no command could emit one** — the
platform told a payer the notice was overdue and gave them no way to give it,
which left "pay in full" as the only advice it could ever offer. The command now
exists and enforces the two requirements that decide whether a notice is worth
anything: it must state the sum considered due **and the basis of calculation**,
because a bare figure has repeatedly been held insufficient, and it cannot exceed
the notified sum, because a notice paying more is not a pay less notice. A late
notice is still recorded, and recorded as ineffective — refusing to write it
would destroy the evidence of what was said and when.

Two boundaries are deliberate. **Statutory periods are counted in days, not
business days**, because the Act says days and a court reads days, so the
deadline never moves; the UK bank holiday calendar (computed, including Easter,
the weekend substitution rules and the three jurisdictions' different days)
answers the separate question of *service*, and the position reports a serve-by
date labelled as what it is. And **no rate is invented**: statutory interest runs
at base rate plus 8%, the base rate is a fact about the outside world this
platform is not connected to, so the entitlement is stated and the amount is not.

Contract terms are assessed against the Act with the distinction that matters —
a term the Act makes **void** is replaced by the Scheme whether anybody noticed
or not, so a contractor who priced for a payment period the Act strikes out has
priced for a cost he does not carry; a term that is merely **onerous** is lawful
and stays his problem. The morning briefing carries the crystallised exposure,
because nobody can serve last month's notice.

**Access control.** Three account layers, RBAC, OAuth2-style scopes, ABAC, in a
fixed fail-closed order. Tenant isolation. Lifecycle phase gating on writes.
Data-sensitivity redaction. Regulator read-only with export. Supplier
confinement. Separation of duties enforced, not advised. Every entity type
declares its capability area and sensitivity, and the audit feed withholds the
patch for records the caller cannot read while keeping the envelope.

Proven over real HTTP rather than by calling handlers: `tests/api.test.ts`
stands the gateway up on a socket and pins the public-route list, the
operator/delivery separation, the tenant filter on the generic entity read, and
the problem+json contract. A route becoming public by accident is a one-word
edit, so the list is asserted rather than trusted.

**Gateway observability.** Monotonic counters (`requests_total`,
`auth_failures_total`, `authz_denies_total`, `rate_limited_total`,
`validation_reject_total`), a fixed-bucket latency histogram per route, and a
security audit stream separate from the request log. Counters are held in
`src/api/telemetry.ts` and are never derived from the bounded log buffer — the
metrics that preceded them were, and so fell as traffic rose, which is the one
direction a request counter must never move. Latency groups by route pattern,
not path, so an id does not fragment a series. Every request record carries the
mandatory fields: route, outcome, authentication result, authorisation decision,
rate-limit key and remaining budget, correlation and trace ids. Audit events
record reason categories only — no token, no credential, no policy attribute
value — and remote addresses are truncated to /24 or /48, enough to see one
source hammering a login and not enough to be a record of who was where.
Published at `/v1/admin/logs` and `/v1/admin/security`, platform-admin only.

**ACU economics.** Route → reserve → execute → persist → debit. Prepaid only,
hard caps, alerts, per-engine attribution. No provider call on an empty wallet;
no charge without a ledger write. `tests/ai.test.ts` proves each of those with a
stub provider that counts its own calls: failover, the empty-wallet refusal
before the request goes out, and a released hold when the provider throws.

**Commercial packaging.** Eight role-priced seats, three packages, three ACU
bundles. The operator and the regulator consume no seat.

**Application.** Nineteen screens against live endpoints, including Autopilot — the queue where a person approves or declines what the agents propose. Role-aware navigation
resolved from the API's permission matrix and phase gates, so the interface
refuses for the reason the platform would. Command surfaces on field, cost,
design, programme, change and handover. Daily site diary. Canonical enum
dropdowns. Evidence hashed with SHA-256 in the browser. Denials are shown as
denials, never as empty records.

**The catalogue is checked against what the platform can do.** An event type in
the closed catalogue with nothing able to emit it is a specific and dangerous
hole: it reads as capability from every direction — the catalogue lists it,
entity access classifies it, the control standard can require evidence of it —
and no command in the platform can ever produce one. It had been found by hand
three times: a snag that could be raised and never closed, a pay less notice the
platform called overdue while offering no way to give one, and a daily diary the
control standard demanded of every project and reported missing forever.

Finding it a fourth time by hand is not a plan, so `tests/catalogue.test.ts`
scans every source file for what is actually emitted and fails on any event that
is neither emitted nor named in a list with the reason it is not. It found
twenty-three. Three were real capability and are now built; the rest are named
with their reason, and every line of that list is a debt. The test also fails on
a stale excuse — an entry claiming something is missing when it is not — because
a list that overstates the gaps stops being read.

**The daily site diary.** The record delay and disruption claims are decided on,
and the one the control standard called "the contemporaneous record no delay
claim survives without" while having no way to write it.

Three rules, each because the diary is evidence rather than administration. It
**cannot be dated ahead** — a record of what happened, written before it happens,
is a plan wearing a diary's clothes. It **states when it was written**, and marks
an entry made days later as what it is, because a diary compiled from memory
three weeks on carries a fraction of the weight and every adjudicator asks; a
platform that presented one as contemporaneous would be handing over a weaker
exhibit than its owner believed. And **weather is required even when it was
fine**, because weather is the commonest ground for an extension of time and a
diary with weather only on the bad days proves nothing about the good ones.

A second entry for the same day is refused unless it names the entry it replaces
and why. Supersession is derived from that reference rather than stamped on the
original: the superseded entry stays readable in full, because somebody may have
acted on it. `diaryPosition` reads the register as an exhibit rather than a list
— the working days with no entry and the entries written long after the fact,
which are the two things the other side looks for first and neither of which is
visible reading it a day at a time. Weekends are not counted as gaps.

**The variation control matrix.** One change, both sides of it. Change is where
money leaves a construction contract quietly, and it leaves in exactly two
directions: a subcontractor's claim the business will pay and never charged on,
and a price agreed with the client before anybody knew what the packages would
cost — which reads as a win on the day and as an unexplained margin drop at
final account. Neither is visible from either register alone.

Two more dead events closed getting there. `VARIATION_VALUED` had nothing
emitting it because the instruction carried a figure and everybody treated that
as the valuation; they are different acts, usually months apart, and the gap
between them is where a main contractor finds out what its subcontractors
actually charged. `CHANGE_REQUEST_REJECTED` had nothing emitting it either, so a
change could be submitted, assessed and simply left — and at final account every
undecided line is argued as though it were live.

**An upstream valuation is refused while the downstream cost it names is
uncaptured.** If the change names affected subcontract packages and not one has
priced it, agreeing with the client means agreeing without knowing your own
cost, and the guess is always low because the claim has not arrived yet. Once
agreed there is no route back. A change naming no subcontracts is self-delivered
and valued without objection.

The two sides are matched on **the change, never on the package**. Two changes
can hit one subcontract — a wall-thickness variation and a dewatering claim are
not each other's downstream cost — and matching loosely would report a
reconciliation that never happened. A false all-clear is worse than a false
alarm, because nobody rechecks it.

Instructing a variation now closes its change request, which it did not: the
request stayed `ASSESSED` forever, so a change could be instructed and then
refused, and the register could not tell an open position from a decided one.

**Answering an RFI, and rescoring a risk.** Two more registers that could only be
added to. An RFI could be raised from a drawing markup and never closed, so the
register could not show which questions held the job up — the exhibit a
design-delay claim is built from. The answer now records the drawing revision it
was given against, alongside the revision the question was asked on, because
answering against a revision the site no longer holds is how an answer becomes a
dispute and it is invisible unless both ends are on the record.

A risk could be registered and never revised. That is not cosmetic: the P80
contingency in every tender and every cost report is computed from these scores,
so a register frozen at the day it was written prices the job against risks as
they were understood before anybody had been on site — precise-looking and
stale. A rescore requires the reason, because a score that moves without one is
an opinion, and the whole value of a register is being able to ask later why the
exposure moved the month before the tender went in.

**Agent runtime — autopilot with a human gate.** Twelve agents across four
divisions, each with a mandate naming what it may read, what it may propose in,
and which roles may decide. The divisions are the answer to "who is watching
what": *market intelligence* (what work is out there), *bid engine* (should we
chase it, at what price, can we fund it), *delivery engine* (are the jobs we
have going wrong, and how early can we tell), and *supply chain* (can we still
buy what we sell). Eight of them are one per engine. They run over materialised
state, raise findings that name the records they were read from, and propose the
command they want run. Then they stop.

Three rules hold the runtime: an agent never writes project state; an agent
cannot propose outside its mandate, checked by the runtime rather than by the
agent; and an agent cannot decide. Approval needs both the capability the
command exercises *and* standing as a nominated approver — reading is not
authorising. The event catalogue refuses an AI actor authoring an approval, so
the guard holds even if the runtime one were bypassed. Approved commands run as
the approving human through the same engine path any manual command takes. A
rejection needs a reason and stays in the record. Repeat findings are suppressed
rather than raised again.

The four watchers added for the front end — radar, pipeline, supply chain and
HSEQ — are observation-only, because none of them can fix what they see. The
radar notices a shortlisted opportunity running out of days, and a requirement
that disqualified the business more than once in a single run. The pipeline
notices an opportunity scored and left, which is worse than one never looked at
because the qualifying is already paid for. Supply chain watches prequalification
and framework expiry, the quiet failure found out on the day an enquiry was
needed. HSEQ watches the duties that are law rather than preference — an
unapproved Construction Phase Plan, an unanswered RIDDOR question, a lapsed
competency — and raises them as urgent whatever else is on the list.

**The morning briefing.** The only screen that answers a question no other one
asks: *what should I do today?* Everything else answers a question about one
subject; a person running a contracting business has a morning and a list of
things that will cost money if nobody touches them. It reads across the whole
tenant, states figures rather than moods, orders by urgency then by value, gives
every action a record it can be checked against, and says plainly when there is
nothing to do.

There is no model anywhere in that path — the one screen somebody acts on before
coffee is arithmetic. Where the platform does not hold a number it stays silent
rather than reporting a confident zero: the payment cycle holds statutory dates
rather than applied sums, so the briefing gives the date and no figure. Building
it caught four fields being read under names the engines do not write — a delay
forecast reading zero on a project forecasting fifty days, and £1.4m of margin
erosion invisible because the cost report holds it as a percentage.

**Weekly newsletter.** A role-targeted issue about what the platform does,
composed from the real feature set and linking only to screens that exist — a
test fails if a link resolves to no page. Consent is a ledger record rather than
a flag, so what a person decided and through which route survives. Unsubscribe
links are HMAC-signed, work without signing in, and are refused when forged; the
GET only ever shows the confirmation, so a mail scanner prefetching links cannot
unsubscribe anybody. One-click unsubscribe (RFC 8058) is honoured.

Campaigns are keyed by ISO week, so a scheduler firing twice, a restart inside
the send window and an operator pressing the button all resolve to one issue.
Delivery is recorded per recipient with what actually happened: a message
composed but not transmitted is `RECORDED`, never `SENT`. SMTP is spoken
directly over `node:net`/`node:tls` — verified in the suite against a real
socket, including STARTTLS refusal and dot-stuffing.

**Installable application with a launch screen.** Web app manifest, generated
icon set (standard and maskable), twelve exactly-sized iOS launch images, and an
in-document splash that paints before `app.js` parses so the handover from the
operating system's own launch screen is invisible. One background colour is
asserted across the manifest, the `theme-color` meta and the CSS, because a
mismatch shows as a flash.

The service worker exists to make the application installable, which is what
makes a launch screen appear at all. **It never touches `/v1/`** — caching an
authorised response would put one identity's project data outside the platform's
access control and serve it to whoever opens the app on that device next.
Offline field work is the sync protocol's job, not a cache's. Shell only,
network-first for navigation, verified by test and in a browser.

Regenerate the assets with `node tools/icons.mjs` after any brand change. The
PNG encoder is in that file: `node:zlib` is built in, so it was shorter than the
argument for a dependency.

**One platform, sole trader to multi-billion.** The same operating system runs a
sole trader fitting a £3,000 bathroom and a joint venture delivering a £2bn
programme. That is not a matter of hiding features — it is a matter of no
threshold in the platform being an absolute money figure, because an absolute
threshold is always wrong at one end.

`src/lifecycle/scale.ts` is the single place the platform decides how big
something is: five project bands from under £25k to over £250m, six organisation
bands from a sole trader under £250k to a Tier 1 over £500m, and the
proportionality rules that follow. Everything else derives from it. The
organisation bands used to start at "under £5m", which treated a £40k business
as a rounding error; they now start where the real users do.

Three things scale from it. **The control standard** marks each of its 36 items
with the smallest project it is proportionate on — a £3,000 repair is measured
against 6 items and a £2bn programme against all 36, and an item below the line
is `NOT_PROPORTIONATE` rather than missing. **The cost model** marks each of its
20 heads the same way, so a bathroom is not told it has omitted commissioning
and temporary works; 13 heads simply do not apply, and the one real omission is
not buried under them. **Quote counts and supplier scrutiny** follow the size of
what is being bought: one quote for a skip, three for a package that matters.

The part that only a ratio can express is the last one. A £400k package is
routine for a £30m contractor and a bet-the-company decision for a £600k one —
same package, different conversation about payment terms and bonding — so
scrutiny rises with exposure to turnover regardless of the absolute figure.
Exposure is annualised where the duration is known, because a £2bn programme
over five years is £400m a year rather than 222% of one year's revenue.

A project whose value nobody recorded is measured against the whole standard.
Quietly excusing items on a job that might be enormous is the more dangerous
failure.

**The corporate project control standard.** Every project runs through the same
four stages — preconstruction, mobilisation, delivery, completion — and the same
36 items, evaluated continuously against the ledger rather than only at a phase
transition. This is deliberately not the phase gate: a gate is a small hard stop
enforced fail-closed on the write path, and this is the wider question of what a
project should have in place right now given where it is. A project can legally
reach handover having kept no site diary; it should not be able to do so
quietly. The standard cross-references which of its items a gate really enforces
rather than restating the rule, so `phases.ts` remains the only thing enforcing.

Four statuses, and the distinctions between them are the whole design. An item
**not yet due** is not a failure — a project in design is not failing for having
no site diary. An item the platform **cannot evidence** is reported as
`NOT_TRACKED` with the reason, never as present and never as missing: claiming
it is satisfied would be a lie, and calling it missing would blame the project
for the platform's gap. Completeness is measured over what is due *and*
trackable, so the figure means something. Six items are currently untracked and
named as such: surveys, procurement schedule, site setup, project insurance,
technical submittals and final account.

`estateControl` runs the same standard over every project at once, which is the
reason for having one standard at all. A project manager can see their own gaps;
only this view shows that the same item is missing on most of the estate, which
is a statement about how the business runs jobs rather than about one job.

**Corporate memory.** Lessons are captured on the project that produced them and
read across the whole business, because a lesson only pays for itself on a
different job. Two rules keep the register from becoming what lessons-learned
workshops usually produce: a lesson must carry a recommendation somebody on the
next job could act on — "communication could have been better" is refused — and
it must name what it cost in money or days. The library reports what recurs
*across projects*, since one job getting ground conditions wrong is bad luck and
the same category on four jobs is a business problem no project team was ever in
a position to see. A library drawing on a single project says so rather than
presenting one job's experience as corporate knowledge.

**The contractor's delivery chain.** Business development → estimating →
preconstruction → contract → project management → commercial → HSEQ →
subcontract procurement → programme → quality → handover, walked end to end by
`tests/chain.test.ts`.

*Business development* was entirely absent — the platform began at a project
that already existed. Opportunities are now registered, scored, and decided by a
person. A converted project carries its opportunity id, so a variation argued
about in year three traces back to the decision to chase the job at all.

**Tender radar.** The value is not in finding more opportunities — it is in not
reading the ones that were never winnable, which is where most of a small
contractor's bid time goes. Notices are screened against a recorded company
profile: turnover, net assets, working capital, regions, sectors, CPV codes,
value band, insurance limits, accreditations, verified references, self-delivered
trades, target margin and spare delivery capacity.

Mandatory requirements fail outright rather than costing points, because a
turnover threshold or a missing accreditation makes an opportunity unwinnable
however attractive it is. **The radar never asserts a capability the profile
does not record**, and an unverified reference is never counted as one — that
is the claim a bid gets disqualified for. Where there is a real route round a
gap it says so: partner the package and offer named personnel experience where
the ITT permits, or ask whether the buyer accepts an equivalent accreditation.

It does not score. There is one scoring model, and a radar with its own would be
a second opinion that quietly disagrees, so it produces *suggested* factor
scores from evidence and hands them to `qualify()`. Two factors a portal notice
cannot answer — client attractiveness and cash-flow risk — are left neutral for
a person rather than guessed. The margin target moves with the competition
against the company's own band rather than being invented.

The batch run keeps every assessment, not just the shortlist, because "why did
we not bid that one" is asked months later. It also names the requirement that
keeps disqualifying the business: failing the same accreditation on four notices
is a decision about the company, not about any one bid, and only the batch view
can see it. Nothing is registered as an opportunity automatically — the radar
decides what is worth reading, a person decides what is worth chasing.

**The bid/no-bid algorithm.** Ten factors weighted to 100 — relevant experience
15, client attractiveness 10, contract size 10, geography 10, supply-chain
capacity 10, competition 10, margin opportunity 15, cash-flow risk 10, strategic
value 5, win probability 5 — each scored 1–5, against published thresholds:
**below 55 no bid, 55–70 director review, above 70 bid**. The rule lives in one
constant and is served to the interface, so there is no second copy to disagree
with it.

Three things make it work rather than merely exist. Every factor carries an
explicit anchor for what 5 means and what 1 means, because two of the ten are
named as risks and a scorer reading "cash-flow risk: 5" as "very risky" inverts
the algorithm on the factors where being wrong costs most. The scale runs 20 to
100, not 0 to 100 — ten factors at 1/5 still return a fifth of every weight, and
a threshold set as though it could reach zero would never fire. And a single
factor at 1/5 holds the job at a director's desk however well the average
scored: a weighted average hides one catastrophic factor behind nine comfortable
ones, and a trade with nobody on the register is a fact rather than a deduction.

Supply-chain capacity is the one factor the platform can answer from evidence
instead of memory: `supplyChainEvidence` reads the register for the trades the
job needs and reports how many are covered three-deep. It suggests and does not
set — the register knows the count, not whether those firms want the job.

**Refusing bad work is measured, not just permitted.** An algorithm nobody
declines against is a form, so `bidDiscipline` reports the no-bid rate as the
headline figure, names every decision taken against the score with who took it
and how it turned out, and — the part that matters most — reports each band
against actual outcomes. If jobs above 70 do not convert better than jobs pushed
through from the review band, the weights are wrong, and an algorithm nobody
checks against outcomes is a slower way of having the same opinion. A pipeline
where nothing has been refused is told so in those terms.

*Estimating* priced eight heads and derived preliminaries from a percentage of
works. It now prices **twenty**: direct works, subcontract, materials, plant,
preliminaries, site management, temporary works, insurance, design,
professional fees, testing, commissioning, waste, logistics, health and safety,
quality, contingency, inflation, overhead and profit.

The heads are not the point — the basis each one is priced on is. Time-related
costs take a weekly rate and a duration, so a programme that moves re-prices the
tender; as a percentage of works they do not, and eight weeks of overrun is
eight weeks of unrecovered site staff. The percentage survives as a benchmark
output, never as an input, and `repriceEstimate` answers what the tender becomes
on a different programme without writing anything, because a what-if is not a
commercial position. Contingency is drawn from the quantified risk register at
P80 rather than being a round number. Inflation is taken to the mid-point of
exposed spend after the base date and never applied to a firm-price subcontract
sum. Insurance is a percentage of the value it actually insures, so it is
computed after risk and inflation, not alongside the fees. Overhead is on cost
and profit is on cost plus overhead.

A head with nothing against it comes back as an **omission**, not as zero — a
tender with nothing priced against waste is not a job with no waste in it. It
must be priced or excluded in writing, and the exclusion becomes tender wording.

**The ITT analyst.** Two outputs, and the second is the one that saves money.
The compliance matrix is ordinary: every requirement with an owner, the evidence
it needs, whether the platform can already prove it, and when it is due. Small
contractors lose bids they priced correctly because one certificate was missing
from the upload, and an owner against every line is the cheapest fix there is. A
requirement the platform cannot probe is `UNKNOWN` rather than a gap — marking
it a gap would bury the real ones under everything nobody automated.

The commercial terms are the half that decides whether the job is worth winning,
and each is assessed against this business rather than transcribed. Liquidated
damages are set against the margin, not reported as a rate. A performance bond
is bonding capacity taken from the next bid as well as this one. Retention is
cash the business funds, not a discount. Three terms end companies and none are
visible in the price: **fitness for purpose**, which almost every professional
indemnity policy excludes, so the obligation sits uninsured; **uncapped
liquidated damages** on a programme the contractor does not control; and a
**parent company guarantee** demanded of a business with no parent, which is a
bar to entry rather than a term to negotiate.

**The cost intelligence database.** It does not invent prices — it organises the
ones the business has already paid, quoted or been quoted, and reports what they
actually say, including when they do not say enough.

It is a projection rather than a store: every rate is read from records already
committed, so nothing is entered twice and nothing can drift. A rate cannot
exist here that was not part of a commercial position somebody signed off.

**A package price is never converted into a unit rate.** A subcontract covers
dozens of measured items and there is no honest way to apportion it back to a
rate per cubic metre; doing so is how a cost database fills with numbers that
look precise and mean nothing. Unit rates come from estimate lines, package
outturns from the market, and the two are kept apart.

Every figure carries what is behind it — the count, the spread and the age of
the newest observation — and confidence is stated rather than implied. A single
observation is called a data point, not a benchmark. Benchmarking an estimate
excludes that estimate's own lines from the median it is compared against;
without that a line is measured against its own reflection and the benchmark
agrees with everything. And the output only accumulation can give: how far this
contractor's estimates sit from what the market returns, which is a fact about
the business rather than about construction.

**Never bid without a cash model.** A contract can cover its cost, carry a
healthy margin, and still take more working capital than the business has — and
the estimate, which is a statement about cost, will not say so. The peak funding
requirement is a different question from the margin and it is the one that
closes companies.

The cost profile is read from the priced estimate rather than typed again, so
the cash model cannot drift from the price, and the heads are regrouped by *how
each is paid*: labour weekly whatever the client does, materials on supplier
terms with a deposit in front, packages on subcontract terms. That mismatch
against the certificate cycle is the funding requirement. Retention is modelled
as cash withheld and returned in two halves — the second long after the defects
period — rather than as a deduction from the price. VAT flows in the direction
it actually flows: under the domestic reverse charge there is no VAT on the sale
to fund the job, while input VAT is still paid out and reclaimed at the return,
which made construction working capital materially harder.

The output is a weekly series, the peak and the week it falls, and a verdict
against available working capital — fundable, tight (over 80% of the cash
committed, which is a bet rather than a plan) or unfundable. Refusing is only
half an answer, so each remedy is priced rather than listed: what an advance
payment, shorter certification, lower retention or longer subcontract terms
would actually be worth, best first.

*The automatic tender response* prices a client enquiry, drafts the
qualifications, exclusions, tender queries and covering letter, and computes
whether the bid is fit to submit. The division of labour is the platform's usual
one: every number comes from the cost model and the model only writes the words.
It refuses to call a bid submittable while a cost head is unpriced, while the
enquiry itself is missing something a bidder needs to price against, or while
the build-up carries no profit — and a gap in the enquiry becomes a question to
the client rather than an assumption the contractor silently absorbs.

*Quality* had three catalogue events and no command able to emit any of them: a
snag could be raised and never closed. There is now an inspection and test plan
with enforced hold points — the platform refuses to release work past a stage
the ITP says must stop — inspections that raise a non-conformance in the same
breath as a failure, and NCR closure with a disposition somebody owns.

*HSEQ* could not record that anyone had been hurt. Incidents now escalate on
category, the RIDDOR question must be answered either way, and training carries
an expiry, because a lapsed competency reads the same as one nobody held.

*The supply chain register* collects Companies House identity, VAT, UTR and CIS
status, insurance, H&S and quality accreditation, RAMS capability, competence
cards, training, references, financial standing, geographic coverage, turnover,
package capacity, day rates, labour availability and plant — and classifies each
firm **Strategic / Approved / Conditional / Do Not Use**.

Three things make it more than a form. **Scrutiny is proportionate**: a £15k
package asks for identity, insurance, tax status and safety, and nothing else;
a £900k package asks for three years of turnover, net assets, a credit
reference and a reviewed RAMS sample. Demanding audited accounts from a
two-person firm for a small package is not diligence, it is an obstacle that
pushes good small firms away. **Strategic is earned on delivery** — three
completed packages with no dispute and 85%+ on time — because anybody can
assemble a good-looking pack. And **bars, missing information and conditions
are reported separately**: "we have not seen your accounts" is a different
conversation from "your insurance has expired".

The rules that bite: a lapsed employers' liability policy, a dissolved company
or an unresolved HSE prohibition notice is a bar, not a deduction; a package
worth more than 40% of last year's turnover raises a condition, because one
job should not be a firm's survival; an unverified reference is a claim; and a
day rate quoted over a year ago is re-confirmed rather than trusted.

*Subcontract procurement* could send an enquiry to anybody at all —
`invitedSupplierIds` was free text. It now runs off a prequalified register of
80+ trades. An expired employers' liability policy is a bar rather than a
deduction; life-safety trades require third-party accreditation; approval
expires; suspension is immediate; and nobody is invited beyond their assessed
package capacity. The enquiry is refused whole rather than quietly dropping the
ineligible, because an RFQ that went to four of the six you selected produces a
comparison you cannot trust.

*Framework agreements* turn the register into standing relationships. The size
is arithmetic rather than a round number: the trades the business actually buys
given what it builds, times enough firms per trade to run a three-quote enquiry
and survive one dropping out, times a concurrency demand — no subcontractor can
hold packages on twenty of your sites at once — divided by the overlap between
trades a real register has, and capped at the relationships a business that size
can genuinely maintain. A £12m residential and refurbishment contractor lands on
70 firms; a £3m fit-out business on 30; a Tier 1 on the low hundreds. The
composition is deliberate too: local SMEs, accredited specialists and large
contractors do different jobs on a framework.

Admission uses the same prequalification gate as an enquiry, because a framework
place is worth more than one package and must not be the weaker route in.
Call-off applies the framework's own rule — rotation orders by fewest awards
then least value, a direct award above the lot's ceiling escalates to a
competition automatically, and a member suspended or lapsed drops out of the
call-off without being expelled. The position report names what is wrong rather
than scoring it: lots too thin to produce a competitive enquiry, a firm above
the concentration limit, members admitted and never used, and how long is left
before re-tendering has to start.

**CDM 2015 and the Principal Contractor's duties.** Twelve document types —
Construction Phase Plan, RAMS, COSHH, temporary works, lifting, working at
height, fire, emergency arrangements, environmental controls, work equipment,
induction, toolbox talk — each declaring the sections it is not valid without.

Drafts are composed from real project state: the description, the significant
risks and the site conditions come from the ledger, which is what makes a
document project-specific rather than a template with a name merged in. A
section the platform cannot fill truthfully is **named as a gap, never
invented** — a fabricated control measure is worse than a blank one, because
somebody will read it and believe it.

The duties are enforced as gates rather than described:

- No construction-phase work, and no induction, without an **approved**
  Construction Phase Plan.
- No approval while a required section is unfilled.
- The signing role is fixed per document type: a lifting plan is signed by the
  constructor, not the safety adviser.
- An agent may draft; **the catalogue refuses an AI actor authoring any safety
  approval.** `RAMS_APPROVED` previously permitted one — a method statement
  signed by a model is not a competent person's signature, and that is now
  closed.

The Principal Contractor position reports **named breaches rather than a
percentage**: a score invites somebody to report 87% compliant, a list of
failures does not.

**Offline field sync.** Device timestamps preserved, operation-id idempotency,
deterministic conflict resolution, monotonic cursors, governance actions refused
from devices.

**Branded exports.** Refuse without branding. Audience-based redaction. Recorded
as Golden Thread events. A document stamped "commercial detail withheld" is now
tested to contain no figures anywhere — including the risk table, which used to
carry priced exposure into a redacted copy.

## What is partial

Implemented in a form that works, with a stated part missing. The missing part is
named so it is not mistaken for finished.

| Area | Built | Missing |
|---|---|---|
| Take-off | Governs, evidences and prices measured items, traced to sheet and revision | Quantities are supplied by the caller, not read from a drawing |
| Drawing register | Title-block structuring from supplied text, supersession, markup→RFI | OCR from the image |
| Model ingestion | Records the model, hash, discipline, LOD, element count as a governed event | IFC parsing, geometry hash, model diffing |
| Digital twin | Reconciles observed against expected element status | Observations are structured input, not derived from imagery |
| Evidence capture | Real SHA-256 over the real file, recorded against the event | No object store for the file itself |
| Clause extraction | From supplied text | OCR and table extraction |
| Knowledge graph | Entities cross-reference by id; the ledger reconstructs lineage | No graph store or traversal API |
| Lookahead planning | Entities in the catalogue | PPC metrics not computed |
| 4D scheduling | Twin states link to task ids | No visualisation |
| PDF export | Structured document model and HTML rendering | PDF rendering |
| Newsletter delivery | SMTP submission verified against a socket, per-recipient outcomes recorded | No bounce processing or suppression list; DKIM belongs at the relay, where the key should live |

## What is not built

Specified in the source documents, deliberately absent, and **not to be claimed
as present**. Most of it is perception and ingestion infrastructure — real ML and
parsing work, not wiring.

- **File ingestion pipeline** — presigned upload, virus scan, MIME validation, ML
  file classifier with confidence, OCR, table extraction, vector embedding,
  `FILE_EXTRACTED`
- **Vision pipeline** — progress estimation, PPE compliance, equipment
  recognition, defect detection, `PROGRESS_EXTRACTED_FROM_IMAGES`
- **Audio and communication intelligence** — transcription, commitment and
  deadline extraction, `COMMITMENT_REGISTERED`, `DEADLINE_TRACKED`
- **Guided project creation form** with canonical enums (projects are created
  through the API)
- **Deployment topology** — Terraform, Kong, MSK, RDS, S3
- **Native Android and iOS clients** — the sync protocol and `ANDROID`/`IOS`
  event sources are built and tested server-side
- **External data feeds** — commodity pricing, weather, credit reference
- **Persistence** — the ledger is in-process; Postgres with RLS and append-only
  rules is designed for, not implemented

## Decisions already made — do not revisit

Re-opening these is what caused churn before.

1. **No property-deal marketplace.** Revenue engines, Buy Box, Funding Box and
   DEAL EQUITY belong to a different product. Explicitly excluded by the user.
2. **Zero runtime dependencies.** Node 22 native type stripping. Dev
   dependencies are `typescript` and `@types/node` only.
3. **No frontend framework and no build step.** Plain ES modules, tagged-template
   HTML escaping by default.
4. **The package, not the seat sum, is charged.** Legacy tiers remain and map to
   packages so existing contracts resolve.
5. **Money is in minor units everywhere.** No floating point in the billing path.
6. **The interface never holds a rule the API does not publish.** Permission
   matrix and phase gates are fetched, not duplicated.
7. **A denial is displayed as a denial.** Never as zero, never as empty.
8. **No agent acts unattended.** Every mandate caps at `PROPOSE`. The `ACT`
   level exists in the model but granting it to an agent is a product decision
   that must be made explicitly; a test fails if one grants it to itself.
9. **Screenshots are gitignored.** Regenerate with
   `node tools/walk.mjs "<role>" "" shots` (`WALK_BASE` overrides the origin).
10. **The newsletter carries no project data.** It is role-targeted, not
    data-personalised. An email leaves the platform's access controls behind
    the moment it is sent, so it contains capability descriptions and links —
    never figures, never commercial or safety content.
11. **The newsletter sender is off by default.** `NEWSLETTER_ENABLED=false`
    everywhere until an operator arms it in one environment deliberately.

## Working notes

- The seeded demo project sits in the **Operations** phase, so field-execution
  and tender writes are correctly phase-gated. This is not a bug; commands show
  as locked with that reason.
- One server instance is enough. `PORT=8123 node src/main.ts`. Seed with
  `POST /v1/console/identities`. Restarting reseeds and changes all ids.
- The browser tools need `playwright-core`, which is deliberately **not** a
  project dependency — dev dependencies are TypeScript and `@types/node` only.
  Both tools now say so and print the install line rather than failing with a
  module-not-found stack.
- The go-to-market plan lives in `docs/go-to-market/`, generated by
  `tools/gtm/`. It quotes the platform's own pricing, so it is kept in the
  repository rather than beside it.
- A project id that does not exist, and one belonging to another tenancy, both
  answer `200` with an empty list on the generic entity read. That is
  deliberate: a `404` for unknown and a `403` for forbidden would together tell
  a caller which project ids exist. Tested, so nobody "fixes" it.
- `tools/walk.mjs` verifies every page renders for a role. `tools/inputs.mjs`
  counts command surfaces per page.
- `tools/walk.mjs` used to take ~30s per page: `locator.textContent()` auto-waits
  and only rejects at the 30s default, so probing for an error notice that was
  legitimately absent cost the full timeout on every healthy page. It reads
  through `count()` now. A full walk is well under a minute.
- The newsletter's weekly timer polls hourly rather than computing a delay, so
  a restart cannot skip a send. Week-keyed campaigns make the polling safe.
- With no `SMTP_HOST`, the Newsletter screen states plainly that nothing is
  being transmitted. That is the configured state in development, not a fault.
